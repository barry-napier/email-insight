# Merge Email Insight Pull Request

## Introduction
Safely merge Email Insight pull requests after comprehensive validation and testing. This command ensures all quality gates, leadership approvals, and integration requirements are met before merging changes to main branch, followed by automatic cleanup and preparation for next development cycle.

## Prerequisites
- Pull request has been created and tested using `test-email-insight-pr.md`
- All required leadership approvals obtained
- CI/CD pipeline passing successfully
- No merge conflicts with main branch
- All acceptance criteria validated and documented

## PR Reference
<pr_reference> #$ARGUMENTS </pr_reference>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Pre-Merge Validation

**PR Status Verification:**
- [ ] Fetch PR status: `gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json state,mergeable,reviews,checks`
- [ ] Verify PR is in "OPEN" state and ready for merge
- [ ] Confirm no merge conflicts with main branch
- [ ] Validate all required reviews are approved
- [ ] Check all CI/CD checks are passing

**Quality Gates Final Validation:**
```bash
# Final validation before merge
echo "üîç Performing final pre-merge validation..."

# Check PR status
PR_STATUS=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json state,mergeable,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup --jq '{state: .state, mergeable: .mergeable, reviewDecision: .reviewDecision, checks: [.statusCheckRollup[]|select(.conclusion != "SUCCESS")]}')

# Validate all checks pass
if [ "$PR_STATUS" != '{"state":"OPEN","mergeable":"MERGEABLE","reviewDecision":"APPROVED","checks":[]}' ]; then
    echo "‚ùå PR not ready for merge. Status: $PR_STATUS"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ PR validation passed - ready for merge"
```

**Leadership Approvals Verification:**
- [ ] **Product Owner (@agent-product-owner)**: Business value and acceptance validation ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Technical Architect (@agent-technical-architect)**: Architecture compliance review ‚úÖ  
- [ ] **UI/UX Designer (@agent-ui-ux-designer)**: Design system compliance *(if applicable)* ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Testing QA Engineer (@agent-testing-qa-engineer)**: Quality assurance approval ‚úÖ

**Testing Results Verification:**
- [ ] All test suites passed (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Code coverage maintained or improved (>80%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met or exceeded
- [ ] Security scan shows no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility validated
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### 2. Branch Synchronization & Conflict Resolution

**Main Branch Synchronization:**
```bash
# Ensure main branch is up to date
echo "üì• Synchronizing with latest main branch..."
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Check for any new conflicts with PR branch
git checkout [pr-branch-name]
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts exist, they must be resolved before merge
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Merge conflicts detected. Please resolve conflicts and re-run."
    echo "Run: git rebase --continue after resolving conflicts"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Branch successfully rebased on latest main"
```

**Final Build Validation on Rebased Branch:**
- [ ] Run complete quality gates after rebase: `npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm test && npm run build`
- [ ] Push rebased branch: `git push --force-with-lease origin [pr-branch-name]`
- [ ] Wait for CI/CD to re-validate after rebase
- [ ] Confirm all checks still pass after synchronization

### 3. Merge Execution & Validation

**Squash Merge with Detailed Commit Message:**
```bash
# Perform squash merge with comprehensive commit message
echo "üîÑ Executing squash merge..."

gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash --body "$(cat <<EOF
$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json title --jq .title)

## Implementation Summary
$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json body --jq .body | grep -A 20 "## üìã Implementation Overview" | head -20)

## Quality Validation Results
- ‚úÖ All unit tests pass ($(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json body --jq .body | grep -o '[0-9]*% coverage' | head -1))
- ‚úÖ All integration tests pass
- ‚úÖ All E2E tests pass across browsers
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks met
- ‚úÖ Security scan: No critical vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

## Leadership Approvals
- ‚úÖ Product Owner: Business value validated
- ‚úÖ Technical Architect: Architecture approved
- ‚úÖ Testing QA: Quality standards met
$(if [[ "$PR_BODY" == *"UI/UX Designer"* ]]; then echo "- ‚úÖ UI/UX Designer: Design compliance verified"; fi)

## Phase Completion
Phase: $(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json labels --jq '.labels[] | select(.name | startswith("phase-")) | .name')
Components: $(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json labels --jq '.labels[] | select(.name | contains("-")) | select(.name | startswith("phase-") | not) | .name' | tr '\n' ', ')

Closes #$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json body --jq .body | grep -o '#[0-9]*' | head -1 | sed 's/#//')

)"

echo "‚úÖ Pull request merged successfully"
```

**Post-Merge Validation:**
- [ ] Verify merge commit appears in main branch: `git log main --oneline -1`
- [ ] Confirm associated issue was closed automatically
- [ ] Check that all branch protection rules were satisfied
- [ ] Validate that merged changes are present in main branch

### 4. Post-Merge Cleanup & Branch Management

**Feature Branch Cleanup:**
```bash
# Clean up merged feature branch
echo "üßπ Cleaning up merged feature branch..."

# Switch to main and pull latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete local feature branch
git branch -d [pr-branch-name]

# Delete remote feature branch
git push origin --delete [pr-branch-name]

# Prune remote tracking branches
git remote prune origin

echo "‚úÖ Branch cleanup completed"
```

**Repository Status Verification:**
- [ ] Confirm main branch includes merged changes
- [ ] Verify no orphaned branches remain
- [ ] Check that tags are updated if applicable
- [ ] Validate repository is in clean state for next development
