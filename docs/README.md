- **Deployment**: Docker + CI/CD

### Development Approach
This project uses a **multi-agent development architecture** with 15 specialized AI agents working in coordinated phases under triple leadership:

#### Leadership Agents
- **Product Owner Agent** üéØ - Strategic oversight and product vision (active in all phases)
- **Technical Architect Agent** üèóÔ∏è - Technical leadership and architectural consistency (active in all phases)
- **UI/UX Designer Agent** üé® - Design system and user experience excellence (active in all phases)

#### Development Agent Teams
- **Foundation Phase**: Project Setup Agent + Database Architect Agent
- **Integration Phase**: Gmail Integration Agent + Backend API Agent  
- **Intelligence Phase**: Subscription Detective Agent + Analytics Engine Agent
- **Interface Phase**: UI/UX Designer Agent + Frontend UI Agent + Unsubscribe Specialist Agent
- **Quality Phase**: Security Guardian Agent + Testing & QA Agent
- **Deployment Phase**: DevOps Agent + Documentation Agent

The **triple leadership model** ensures comprehensive excellence: the Product Owner Agent maintains product vision and user focus, the Technical Architect Agent ensures architectural consistency and technical quality, and the UI/UX Designer Agent guarantees exceptional user experience and accessibility. Each specialist agent delivers focused components that integrate seamlessly within this guided framework.
